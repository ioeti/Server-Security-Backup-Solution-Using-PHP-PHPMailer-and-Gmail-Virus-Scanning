//Set Up Cron Job to Run the Script Automatically:
//*************************************************

//Access the cron configuration by opening your crontab file. 
//You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

  crontab -e


//Add a New Cron Job:
//*******************

//To run the script twice a day, you can specify the times in the cron schedule. 
//For example, to run the script at 2 AM and 2 PM, add the following lines to the crontab file:

0 2,14 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/script.php

//This means:
//0: Run at the 0th minute (the start of the hour).
//2,14: Run at 2 AM and 2 PM.
//* * *: Run every day, every month, and every day of the week.
// /usr/bin/php: Path to the PHP binary (this may vary depending on your system; check the correct path with which php).
// /path/to/your/script.php: The path to your PHP script. 


//Verify Cron is Working:
//***********************

  //Once the cron job is saved, you can verify it is scheduled correctly 
  //by listing your cron jobs:

  crontab -l

  //Check logs in /var/log/syslog (or /var/log/cron 
  //depending on your Linux distribution) to ensure cron jobs are running:

  grep CRON /var/log/syslog

// Permissions and Execution:
//**************************

  //Make sure the PHP script has execution permission, 
  //or simply ensure the web server user has the correct permissions to access it:

  chmod +x /path/to/your/script.php

//Summary:
//*******

//The cron job will automatically run the script at 2 AM and 2 PM every day, 
//handling the gzip operation and sending the email.
//This setup doesn't require any manual intervention once configured.
